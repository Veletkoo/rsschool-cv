            Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth
            as possible.
            Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are
            incorporated, but still retain some
            texture.
            Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish
            (optional).
